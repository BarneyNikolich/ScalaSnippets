Scala Snippets!

This is a work in progress.

I am creating a basic HTML wiki style document to record snippets of SCALA for later reference and use. The purpose is to learn Scala and brush up on front-end skills at the same time. 

I will be recording basic Scala problems/ scenarios/ snippets of code which I will most likely forget otherwise.
